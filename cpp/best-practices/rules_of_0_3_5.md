## Rules of 0 / 3/ 5

### Special ops

- Destructor
- Copy ctor
- Copy assignment
- Move ctor
- Move assignment

If you define one of them - define all others (because they will not be generated by default).

**Basic idea**:
If you have defined special op then you are doing something that cant be handled be default impl! That means that 
most probably default impls for other ops will also need something additional and thats why we will not generate them at all.

If you use RAII to manage resources, **define** or **delete** all spec ops (**delete** is for legacy, because custom destructor dosent prevent the generation of copy ctor and copy assignment, though this is deprecated).
