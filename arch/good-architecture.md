As we previously stated, a good architecture must support:

- The use cases and operation of the system.
- The maintenance of the system.
- The development of the system.
- The deployment of the system

*My own version of this is:*

Architecture of a software system should first satisfy all the functional and non-functional reqs and second, be maximally flexible, that is, it should allow easy addition of new requirements and introduction of new tech: new databases, frameworks, web servers, etc.
