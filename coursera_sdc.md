### What representations for path can be used for local path generation? (Name two most popular ones and are their pro/cons)

### What is optimization problem formulation for local path generation? What is input/output? What is the difference between hard & soft constraints? Which objective functions can be used?

### Which libs can be used to solve local path generation optimization problem?

### What is velocity profile for a path? How can it be generated? (Name several methods) What is input/output for that process?

Velocity profile is an array of velocity values, one for each timestemp.
Essentially wnat we have as an input is target velocity, which can be defined by different factors (road signs, other object, speed limits).

So once we have that target velocity we need to reach it a hold into it.

Approaches to reach target velocity would be 
- Linearly go for it and reach it at the end of time horizon.
- Linearly go for it and reach it at as soon as possible (co.

### What is Minkowski sum? Draw an example with 2 shapes. How is it used in motion planning? Draw an example of some workspace.
